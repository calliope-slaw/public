          <p>This is WWA trying to begin actually laying out terms and making arguments. He sucks at it.</p>
<div class="kybalion">
    "Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted,
    from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition;
    pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation
    is a Mental Art."--The Kybalion.

A sleight of hand so WWA can refer to thinking really hard about things as "alchemy." 
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
But it must not be supposed that the ancients were ignorant of that which the modern schools suppose to be their exclusive and special property. The records engraved on the stones of Ancient Egypt show conclusively that the ancients had a full comprehensive knowledge of astronomy, the very building of the Pyramids showing the connection between their design and the study of astronomical science. Nor were they ignorant of Chemistry, for the fragments of the ancient writings show that they were acquainted with the chemical properties of things; in fact, the ancient theories regarding physics are being slowly verified by the latest discoveries of modern science, notably those relating to the constitution of matter. Nor must it be supposed that they were ignorant of the so-called modern discoveries in psychology--on the contrary, the Egyptians were especially skilled in the science of Psychology, particularly in the branches that the modern schools ignore, but which, nevertheless, are being uncovered under the name of "psychic science" which is perplexing the psychologists of to-day, and making them reluctantly admit that "there may be something in it after all."
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Look really carefully at what happened there. In two cases he's describing simple history: people in the past knew astronomy and chemistry. Yes. Obviously. 
<p><em>Then</em> he parallels those two statements to claim the ancients were doing psychology, especially the Egyptians. He doesn't say how, or what they were doing, or what the point was. He doesn't offer any evidence. He just lumps one false claim in with two true claims. I can't quite remember the proper name of this fallacy, but sometimes I call it lumping. One thing is lumped in with several others, and so you swallow them all at once without noticing one is false.</p>
<p>What he's doing overall is trying to claim that magic is basically fancy psychology (when it's not superstition), and that this magic is... thinking really hard about things.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
"Transmutation" is a term usually employed to designate the ancient art of the transmutation of metals--particularly of the base metals into gold. The word "Transmute" means "to change from one nature, form, or substance, into another; to transform" (Webster). And accordingly, "Mental Transmutation" means the art of changing and transforming mental states, forms, and conditions, into others. So you may see that Mental Transmutation is the "Art of Mental Chemistry," if you like the term--a form of practical Mystic Psychology.

This is literally slapping "mental" onto a thing and behaving as though he's talking about something profound. Mental swimming is like swimming, but mental. But you can see where he's going in the next bit.
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
The first of the Seven Hermetic Principles is the Principle of Mentalism, the axiom of which is "THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental," which means that the Underlying Reality of the Universe is Mind; and the Universe itself is Mental--that is, "existing in the Mind of THE ALL." We shall consider this Principle in succeeding lessons, but let us see the effect of the principle if it be assumed to be true.
<p>If the Universe is Mental in its nature, then Mental Transmutation must be the art of CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, along the lines of Matter, Force and mind. So you see, therefore, that Mental Transmutation is really the &quot;Magic&quot; of which the ancient; writers had so much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few practical instructions. If All be Mental, then the art which enables one to transmute mental conditions must render the Master the controller of material conditions as well as those ordinarily called &quot;mental.&quot;</p>

There's a BIG IF there WWA. 
<p>So, first, there's a freshman-level solipsism happening here. <em>If</em> the universe exists in the thoughts of a God, then it does not necessarily follow that the universe is -- and is only -- a mental state.</p>
<p>My cat exists in my mind, I think of him often. But he is not <em>only</em> my thought about him. The solipsism is in basically ignoring the autonomy of everything not the reader, as we'll see as we go.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, WWA is never going to prove this if statement. He's relying on it to make further claims, basically begging the question. <em>If</em> the universe is all mental, and <em>if</em> people can sit down and think really hard and control their mental states, <em>then</em> they can sit down and think really hard and control &quot;material conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Except even then this doesn't follow, because nothing in these assumptions, even if we did give them to WWA, demonstrates that changing mental states in oneself is the same as changing mental states <em>in someone else</em>, and &quot;the All&quot; is necessarily &quot;someone else,&quot; even if we're part of it. But for the solipsism at the core of The Kybalion, nothing else <em>really</em> exists except the nebulous &quot;All&quot; and the reader.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
As a matter of fact, none but advanced Mental Alchemists have been able to attain the degree of power necessary to control the grosser physical conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of earthquakes and other great physical phenomena.

<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Let me think this one through. Once again, WWA is just providing an excuse for why you haven't heard of his girlfriend -- she's from Canada, you see. But, also, he's seriously saying that people who caused earthquakes and tempests *also* didn't do so in a way that other people could notice. 
<p>Motherfucker made an earthquake and nobody felt it. Insert joke about trees falling here.</p>

<div class="kybalion">
The student and practitioner of Mental Transmutation works among the Mental Plane, transmuting mental conditions, states, etc., into others, according to various formulas, more or less efficacious.

What the *fuck* is a "material condition depending upon the minds of other people?" My paycheck? 
<p>He's playing three card monte here. Watch the queen, now watch her move, you know where she is, right? It's misdirection. If you think really hard about stuff, you can change stuff, and your poverty, lack of opportunities, and poor health are all resting on stuff. He promises. It has absolutely nothing to do with material conditions, because those are contingent. On <em>stuff</em>. This is likely one of the sources of contemporary New Thought's victim blaming mindset: it doesn't matter if you were born into poverty, or in a country that systemically oppresses and alienates anyone with your skin color. It's not even important that you live in a capitalist hellscape that prioritizes investor profits over quality, safety, and health. No. You're just not thinking hard enough to change the <em>stuff</em> underyling those &quot;material conditions.&quot;</p>

Chapter IV: The All. 
<p>&quot;Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change,
is ever to be found The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental
Truth.&quot;--The Kybalion.</p>
<p>&quot;Substance&quot; means: &quot;that which underlies all outward manifestations; the essence; the essential reality; the thing in itself,&quot; etc. &quot;Substantial&quot; means: &quot;actually existing; being the essential element; being real,&quot; etc. &quot;Reality&quot; means: &quot;the state of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed; permanent; actual,&quot; etc.</p>

This is WWA doing Kant's *ding-an-sich*, the Thing in Itself. But badly. 
<p>English professors in training learn just enough philosophy to be dangerous, so I'm not an expert here, but essentially, Kant divided away the &quot;phenomena&quot; of a thing, which is to say what we observe of it, from its essence, the <em>thing in itself</em>. And that is <em>not</em> universally acceptable in philosophy, for what it's worth. But yeah. You know. Philosophy! Sure! Maybe WWA is going to add something of substance to the centuries of debate about Kant's ideas!</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All philosophies worthy of the name have been based upon this thought. 
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
 No. No he did not. If it's not clear, no, it's untrue that "all philosophies worthy of the name have been based upon" Kantian objectivism. *No*. Bad WWA. 
<p>He also continues his weird schtick of talking about Spinoza's ideas without ever mentioning him or using his terminology. I don't know why, but my guess is that he can't risk telling the reader where he's getting what little philosophy he's actually using, because they'll go read it and find out this book is garbage in comparison.</p>
<p>Notably, too, Spinoza eventually uses his pantheism to claim that people <em>necessarily</em> must be altruistic, and that governments <em>must</em> take care of their citizens, based on his earlier claims. WWA can't fuck with that. New Thought is all about getting yours and blaming the other guys because they didn't think hard enough.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there must always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. Man considering the Universe, of which he is a unit, sees nothing but change in matter, forces, and mental states. He sees that nothing really IS, but that everything is BECOMING and CHANGING. Nothing stands still-everything is being born, growing, dying-the very instant a thing reaches its height, it begins to decline--the law of rhythm is in constant operation--there is no reality, enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything-- nothing is permanent but Change. He sees all things evolving from other things, and resolving into other things--constant action and reaction; inflow and outflow; building up and tearing down; creation and destruction; birth, growth and death. Nothing endures but Change. And if he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing things must be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying Power--some Substantial Reality.

<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
A long one, but I want you to observe the bullshitting happening. This is another long passage where he just repeats himself, to try to make his point sound convincing. Then he caps it off by saying, "oh, and *obviously* there's underlying fixed reality to it all." 
<p>HOW?</p>
<p>It's not rare or unique to make this claim, but he doesn't say why it's true. Instead, he says &quot;thinking m[e]n&quot; realize it. Which is to say, if you <em>don't</em> think that, you're <em>not</em> a thinking man. It's classic NLP shit, basically. He's attaching the idea to an image of intelligence, rather than being intelligent himself.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and have called this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the Hermetic name of "THE ALL," which term we consider the most comprehensive of the many terms applied by Man to THAT which transcends names and terms.

<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
No one ever called it that. Except *kind of* Spinoza. And you won't talk about him. 
<p>It's also notable that it means nothing. Like, it's devoid of meaning. If you're talking about <em>everything</em>, then you're talking about <em>nothing</em>, because that's not how categorical definitions work. And he's relying on his poor logic. His argument only works <em>with</em> the poor logic. Everything can be both radically different (rhythmic, I guess), and the same thing (The All) because the <em>word</em> &quot;all&quot; means &quot;all things.&quot; so he's just using a word that goes &quot;uh... all the stuff&quot; and then claiming <em>that proves</em> everything is one thing, and reality is one thing, and it's called &quot;The All&quot; because, well, you can do that. Words can do things. Phonemes go brrrr.</p>
<p>I want to briefly jump forward in the next selection.</p>

He's ADMITTING YOU CAN'T NAME IT. He's ADMITTING THE NAME IS BULLSHIT. Because he has to, because that's a little too much to say all at once. But he's clouding the issue by doing an appeal to authority: the Wise do this. I won't explain it (can't explain it), but it means I'm right. 
<p>Insofar as it <em>is</em> a real thing in the history of philosophy, that the Thing in Itself is unknowable (and it is), he could have at least appealed to <em>actual</em> authorities. But then again he's have to know what the fuck he's talking about. And maybe he does! But he can't risk <em>you</em> learning enough to see through his stream of bullshit.</p>

And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and characteristics, even down to the pettiest qualities of mankind,

(At this point, it may be proper for me to state that we make a distinction between Religion and Theology--between Philosophy and Metaphysics. Religion, to us, means that intuitional realization of the existence of THE ALL, and one's relationship to it; while Theology means the attempts of men to ascribe personality, qualities, and characteristics to it; their theories regarding its affairs, will, desires, plans, and designs, and their assumption of the office of '' middle-men'' between THE ALL and the people. Philosophy, to us, means the inquiry after knowledge of things knowable and thinkable; while Metaphysics means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond the boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable, and with the same tendency as that of Theology. And consequently, both Religion and Philosophy mean to us things having roots in Reality, while Theology and Metaphysics seem like broken reeds, rooted in the quicksands of ignorance, and affording naught but the most insecure support for the mind or soul of Man. we do not insist upon our students accepting these definitions--we mention them merely to show our position. At any rate, you shall hear very little about Theology and Metaphysics in these lessons.)

<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
 These definitions are wrong in every detail. Additionally, he in fact repudiated religion a few chapters ago, and certainly never talks about "knowledge of things knowable and thinkable" -- BY HIS OWN ADMISSION -- and so he's certainly not doing philosophy.

Here comes the puerile shit based on language but extrapolated out into the world itself. It's like a kid saying they hate another kid "times infinity." You can say that. You can say whatever the fuck you want. Words are easy to say. 
<p>I can divide my apple by zero.</p>
<p>I can multiply my coffee by rugs.</p>
<p>I can sequence my wood via robins.</p>
<p>I can say the All is everything.</p>
<p>The following point is just restating good philosophers like Spinoza so I won't bore you with it, it's long. He's basically saying the All is infinite -- hahaaaa told you -- and that it must be all powerful and all enduring and blah blah blah Spinoza.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE, or not subject to change in
    its real nature, for there is nothing to work changes upon it
    nothing into which it could change, nor from which it could
    have changed. It cannot be added to nor subtracted from;
    increased nor diminished; nor become greater or lesser in any
    respect whatsoever. It must have always been, and must always
    remain, just what it is now--THE ALL--there has never been,

 This is, well, it's *also* Spinoza but I wanted to pull it out because it doesn't actually follow, and I think this about Spinoza. I don't think there's any inherent reason to presume that a "first mover" must necessarily be unchanging. Maybe it is, but I think a *lot* of philosophers who claim it is don't do the work, they don't prove it as rigorously as everything else. Spinoza is often pointed to as one of the most rigorous philosophers in history. He laboriously goes through every little detail. And I think he doesn't actually prove this the way he does everything else. 
<p>Compare it to some of the ideas people have written about concerning G-d in Kabbalah, where the reason for existence itself is to, in some way, help G-d change itself, to grow and get things it didn't already have.</p>
<p>Not that this is relevant, but it's my personal opinion that something that is not changing is most accurately described as <em>dead</em>.</p>

<div class="kybalion">
THE ALL being Infinite, Absolute, Eternal and Unchangeable it must follow that anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned cannot be THE ALL. And as there is Nothing outside of THE ALL, in Reality, then any and all such finite things must be as Nothing in Reality.

We see around us that which is called "Matter," which forms the physical foundation for all forms. Is THE ALL merely Matter? Not at all! Matter cannot manifest Life or Mind, and as Life and Mind are manifested in the Universe, THE ALL cannot be Matter, for nothing rises higher than its own source

Matter manifests life and mind all the time, you fucking dipshit. That's what it *does*. 
<p>And hilariously, <em>Etidorhpa</em> disproved the whole thing about rising higher than the source a few decades before this. It's a fluid dynamics thing. WWA is going off the pseudo-scientific ideas that were originally based on Newton. Maybe you've seen Neil Degrasse-Tyson hold a wrecking ball to his nose, release it, and stand unmoving as the ball swings on a chain out and stops before smashing his face in. That's Newton -- without more energy imparted to the ball somehow, by a push maybe, the swing backwards will be identical to the swing forwards -- and technically <em>slightly</em> shorter, because of friction and so forth. That's real science. But then people tried to apply it to metaphysics and ughhhghghghghh.</p>

 This is an attempt -- in yet another unsourced quotation, mind you -- to prove that the All isn't energy or force (so he can say later that it's life and mind, having systematically gone through all the other options -- he doesn't, but he pretends he does). I'm quoting it particularly because it's a very special form of bullshitting. It just... is patently untrue. Like, it's kind of bullshit in the philosophical sense, because it's neither true nor untrue. It's just words. 
<p>See, look through it. The verb &quot;manifests&quot; is the hinge point. I can point out, for example, that platinum acts as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid and no platinum is present in the acid thereby produced, so it was a cause that did not &quot;manifest&quot; in the effect.</p>
<p>WWA's response would presumably be that it manifests through the presence of the acid at all, that it's &quot;present&quot; in causing the reaction in the first place. Because &quot;manifest&quot; is a weasel word, it means whatever he needs it to mean.</p>
<p>It <em>actually</em> means &quot;clearly revealed to the eye or the understanding, open to view or comprehension&quot;, and comes from a Latin word that meant, basically, direct evidence used in the legal system (<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/manifest#etymonline_v_6804">EtymOnline</a>).</p>
<p>So the platinum isn't present, so it therefore did not &quot;manifest,&quot; as it's not <em>fucking present</em>.</p>

What is there then higher than Matter or Energy that we know to be existent in the Universe? LIFE AND MIND!

Sigh. Who said they're "higher?" What's "mind?" We have a whole branch of philosophy -- and another whole branch of science -- devoted to figuring that out, and we don't have an answer. 
<p>That's why WWA has chosen it of course. It can mean whatever he wants it to mean.</p>
</div></div>
<br>
<div class="kybalion">
The answer is "LIVING MIND," as far above that which mortals know by those words, as Life and Mind are higher than mechanical forces, or matter--INFINITE LIVING MIND as compared to finite "Life and Mind." We mean that which the illumined souls mean when they reverently pronounce the word: "SPIRIT!"
<p>&quot;THE ALL&quot; is Infinite Living Mind--the Illumined call it SPIRIT!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="../images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
 Gods above and below, he's so fucking stupid. 
<p>Why are life and mind &quot;higher&quot; than mechanical forces? What mind isn't alive? An infinite mind would necessarily not be mind, because mind is, as far as we can tell, as much about selecting what not to think and remember as it is about selecting what to think and remember. An infinite mind would be a blank sheet of paper. Which is, of course, what WWA wants. Something he can scribble his bullshit on and then sell.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's &quot;spirit&quot; too -- despite his condescension towards theology earlier. And he offers, you note, absolutely no reasoning for using one term as another. He's just declaring &quot;living mind&quot; == &quot;spirit&quot; with no evidence or argumentation. Just another tired appeal to authority.</p>
