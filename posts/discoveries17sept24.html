          <p>I know I've seen people do this before, but I'm inspired by <a href="https://sweetfish.site/">SweetFish</a> who used to do this on cohost. This is a collection of the fascinating and wonderful things I've come across lately, with more or less commentary as the case may be.</p>
<p>Aurahack wrote [an all too familiar piece about numbers on web sites] and how cohost changed that for the better, before it succumbed to capital's lack of interest. I agree with everything she wrote; I remember constantly refreshing my Livejournal page to see if anyone had commented. Hell, I did that with my <em>email</em>, in <em>1999</em> when absolutely no one in high school was interested in emailing me.</p>
<p>I knew some of the history of the Grimm brothers' collection of fairy tales, but I came across <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/young-women-were-the-true-originators-of-the-grimms-tales">this article</a> which goes into excellent detail, with enough supposition to help contextualize the facts.</p>
<p>On Heat Death, there's <a href="https://heat-death.ghost.io/orcs-is-man-to-orc/">an excellent essay</a> about Tolkien's orcs, how many people have oversimplified Tolkien's work and then criticize him based on the oversimplification, and how to dig in to what's really there. I don't agree absolutely, totally, 100% with every single jot and tittle, but overall this is great.</p>
<p>Ben Frosh wrote about <a href="https://medium.com/@benfrosh/natb-a-personal-story-b0026fb42461">the ATB battle system in Final Fantasy</a> and now a change in the way it tracks animations messed it up in 6, as well as their contribution to a ROM hack that fixes it.</p>
<p>P. James Stuart wrote a <a href="https://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2024/08/thief-and-butterfingered-infinity.html">long piece about Thief, TTRPGS</a>, and the lessons one might learn from the former to run the latter.</p>
