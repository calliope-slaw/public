          <p>OK, so ever since I signed up for neocities I've been somewhat concerned over the guy who runs it, but hadn't seen any concrete things other than the site's acceptance of crypto. As much as I hate that shit, a lot of places did decide to accept it in the past few years.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, he's also a shithead in fun new ways. Over on the Website League, people surfaced an essay he wrote recently that is both stupid and vile: <a href="https://archive.is/W8aUa">Moratorium on freaking out about AI</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't want to read it -- and why would you? -- he basically condescends to everyone, trying to distract the reader by talking about computer history. He essentially says &quot;AI&quot; is as important as <em>computers themselves</em>. Even though right at the end he says we should call it &quot;machine learning&quot; instead. Which is, like, it's the &quot;worst man you know makes a good point meme,&quot; but in context seems like an effort to distract further by avoiding the term that everyonw knows is the bullshit thing. Lots of machine learning <em>isn't</em> bullshit, like the Merlin bird id app.</p>
<p>He lists a bunch of thing AI is revolutionizing, that includes climate change, medicine, and art. All those things are morally, ethically, and practically <em>bad</em>. Machine learning servers are already ruining the environment <em>even more</em>!</p>
<p>So anyway. I'm moving. <a href="https://calliope.prof/">Here's my new site domain</a>. It's exactly the same site. And, in fact, this post is going to go live on it, because I'm just mirroring everything. But I wanted to make sure everyone who's subscribed here via rss has a chance to point their subscriptions to the new place. Here's the new RSS link: <a href="https://calliope.prof/rss.xml">https://calliope.prof/rss.xml</a>.</p>
<p>I know comments on the new site are broken, I'll fix that soon.</p>
