          <p>All right, well, here we are again, reading the first actual chapter of this shitshow. It's just an expansion of the bullshit history from the introduction, with more of the special pleading about how this text will only work for people ready to hear it -- so, you know, anyone who doesn't like it just &quot;wasn't ready,&quot; it's not that there are fundamental flaws with it or anything. He continues to insult basically all religions and anyone who's not white. He also says a Dumb Thing about alchemy.</p>

Ahistorical bullshit. He's trying to say there was a Mason's lodge in ancient Egypt, basically, or really the Even Better version of that, which Masons are copying. 
<p>But the issue of course is that Egypt had its own priestly traditions, and Atkinson is just kind of making up what he wants to be there.</p>
<p>They weren't teaching anybody who wandered by (he literally says they did) they taught the people enrolled in their apprenticeships and those who lived in and worked for the temples.</p>
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion">
But among these great Masters of Ancient Egypt there once dwelt one of whom Masters hailed as "The Master of Masters." This man, if "man" indeed he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest days. He was known as Hermes Trismegistus. He was the father of the Occult Wisdom; the founder of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his life story are lost to history, owing to the lapse of the years, though several of the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the honor of having furnished his birthplace--and this thousands of years ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early days of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the days of Moses. The best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham acquired a portion of his mystic knowledge from Hermes himself.
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Ok this is a long one. This is the entire paragraph. It's Atkinson's move to position himself as the heir to Hermeticism. He is not. His work has nothing to do with the actual texts we have attributed in one way or another to Hermes Trismegistus. 
<p>First, no traditions say Hermes was around at the time of Abraham. It's always Moses. You can see Atkinson trying to argue with that as he brings up Moses for no apparent reason. If &quot;the best authorities&quot; think otherwise, Atkinson could easily quote them. He doesn't. He never will.</p>
<p>Astrology is mainly from Etruscan and Phoenician sources, last I read, filtered through Greece and Egypt. Egypt <em>had</em> its own astrology, but we don't actually know much about it. It appeared to be based on the hours and the decans, with each decans housing a god that was propitiated when they ruled the heavens.</p>
<p>One of the <em>actual</em> founders of alchemy as we know it was a woman named Maria, who invented a number of the devices still used today, but Atkinson could never admit <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>It's unclear to me why Atkinson needs Hermes Trismegistus to be even older than his traditions said he was. He's obviously peddling the idea that the older something is the better it is. But I feel like the time of <em>Moses</em> is pretty fucking old. My first thought it some kind of weird anti Jewish sentiment, as Moses is the epitome of Jewish magic and wisdom. But Abraham isn't exactly a gentile.</p>
<p>Atkinson probably knew his christianized Torah well enough, but this actually introduces more complications than otherwise. Moses learned Egyptian wisdom, and in fact led Egyptian military, before going into the wilderness and hearing G-d. He's a prime candidate for learning Trismegistus's teachings and injecting them into Judaism, and therefore Christianity. But Abraham doesn't make any sense in this role.</p>
<p>I really can't talk my way into figuring this one out. It's just nonsensical. If anybody else has any ideas, let me know.</p>
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion"> 
the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the name of Thoth. Years after, the people of Ancient Greece also made him one of their many gods--calling him "Hermes, the god of Wisdom."
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Haha bullshit. Specifically, it's mixing up cause and effect. Thoth and Hermes the god don't come *from* Trismegistus. It's more complicated than that. Thoth was a god, and some of the Hermetic texts make it seem as though Trismegistus is that god, Hermes just being one of the names you use for that god if you're writing in Greek. is also appears in at least one text. 
<p>Other texts seem to identify Trismegistus even more closely with the Greek Hermes, as he talks about his planet's position in regards to the Sun. But in some texts he's plainly human.</p>
<p>So Atkinson is trying to have it both ways while <em>also</em> insulting ancient Egypt. Hermes was a human sage who was turned into a god after the fact by the credulous Egyptians, and also Hermes <em>is</em> that ancient god of wisdom.</p>
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion">
Even to this day, we use the term "hermetic" in the sense of "secret"; "sealed so that nothing can escape"; etc.
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
ðŸ« 
<p>&quot;Hermetic seals&quot; as a term comes from Hermes's association with alchemy, where you need to seal the tubes. Not from any supposed secrecy involved.</p>
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion">
[The Egyptian sages] did not believe in "casting pearls before swine," but rather held to the teaching "milk for babes"; "meat for strong men," both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the Christian scriptures, but both of which had been used by the Egyptians for centuries before the Christian era.
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Oh yeah? Sauce. Where's the sauce? 
<p>This is a trick. He's quoting a text readers will know in order to trigger their feelings, as well as a sense of superiority, as they're obviously the men, not the babies, and then saying it's really ancient Egyptian wisdom.</p>
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion">
The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions, but never identified with any particular country, nor with any particular religious sect. 
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Except Egypt I guess. He can't even be consistent for two paragraphs in a row. For fuck's sake. 
</div></div>
<br><div class="kybalion">
This because of the warning of the ancient teachers against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of history. The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was largely lost, owing to the fact that the teachers became priests, and so mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious superstition, cults, creeds and "gods." So it was with Ancient Greece and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and Early Christians, which were lost at the time of Constantine, whose iron hand smothered philosophy with the blanket of theology, losing to the Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the way back to its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get back to its ancient mystic teachings.
</div>
<br>
<div class="kybcommentscontainer">
<div class="icon"><img src="https://calliopemagic.neocities.org/images/icon.JPG"></div><div class="kybcomments">
Ok. I. All right. 
<p>ðŸ¤¢</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤®</p>
<p>Right ok.</p>
<p>All right. I don't have to tell you, I hope, how that's deeply racist and insulting. In fact, it's also stupid, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Greek and Roman culture had just as much magic and &quot;superstition&quot; as the Persians.</p>
<p>India still has an incredible, flourishing plurality of philosophical traditions to this day.</p>
<p>He's pulling a fast one. He's claiming not to be part of superstitious religion but also laying claim to the work of religions. Again, Hermeticism was a product of the priest system of Egypt. It is <em>explicitly</em> religious and magical in the senses we would recognize Egyptian priestcraft to be, especially in what's known now as the &quot;technical Hermetica&quot; (though the &quot;philosophical Hermetica&quot; is still a set of instructions for getting at the gods, so yeah).</p>
<p>He's <em>also</em> engaging in some good old fashioned misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. This is some Oswald Spengler shit, though his dumbass book was published after The Kybalion.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer has a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>The short version is that people took the old metaphor of the state or society as a body (the shield of a military, the leader as head of state, and so on) and literalized it via evolutionary theory, or a bad misreading of same. If societies are alive, then they must evolve. And since evolution is a constant upward trend towards improvement (no it's not), and since some societies &quot;failed,&quot; they must <em>devolve</em> -- much in the same way that, if white Europeans are the highest pinnacle of evolution (they aren't) and they still produce murderers and rapists, individuals must <em>devolve</em>.</p>
<p>So Atkinson is drawing on that line of thought that was a few decades old already, steeped as it is in racism and ahistorical claims, to basically excuse himself from pilfering all over the place.</p>
<p>You see, if Hermes Trismegistus is the source of all mysticism -- but not religion, those are totally different things, and not in any way related both anecdotally and historically -- and if all these societies that happen to be old and full of people the wrong color, who we already &quot;know&quot; are devolved, or not as evolved, as us white people, Atkinson says, then we can just take their shit.</p>
<p>See the following passage's final line.</p>

That's what the "key" rhetoric is doing -- insulating him from *true* claims that he's riding someone else's coattails and stealing from every other pocket as he goes along.

<br><div class="kybalion">
It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts, which were non-understandable to outsiders, but which were readily understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes

So this is Atkinson special pleading again, insofar as the *reason* you won't understand any of the fucking gobbledygook in this book is that you aren't being taught by the right people -- definitely not because it's nonsensical. 
<p>However, he's <em>also</em> cribbing from both Buddhism and &quot;druidic&quot; stuff here, I suspect. Buddhism has an <em>actual</em> tradition of things like koans, which don't appear to make sense at first until you arrive at an understanding of the practices, doctrines, and metaphysics of the religion. The &quot;druidic&quot; stuff is what I'm seeing when he says this was passed on orally instead of written down -- it wasn't that long beforehand that Iolo Morganwg passed off his writing as newly-discovered manuscripts that had been written down in the last dying age of the druids, recording their oral traditions. It's also <em>actually true</em> that real historical druids seem to have been forbidden to write down their stuff. That's why we know virtually none of it now.</p>
<p>This is only important insofar as he's quietly grabbing hold of even more popular stuff to shore up his house built with no foundation.</p>

<br><div class="kybalion">
These teachings really constituted the basic principles of "The Art of Hermetic Alchemy," which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements

Alchemy always involves chemicals (or plants and minerals, which I mean those are also technically made of chemicals). It's just sparkling psychology otherwise. Is this the *source* of all the idiotic bullshit I see on HHoL all the time about how "real alchemy" is actually psychology with some meditation sprinkled in?
