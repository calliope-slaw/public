          <p>I am, once again, changing where I'm blogging. I know, this is getting annoying. But the overhead for blogging the way I was doing, in a fully static site environment, was making me not want to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, more in a minute, but here's the new rss link:</p>
<p><a href="https://calliope.bearblog.dev/feed/">https://calliope.bearblog.dev/feed/</a></p>
<p>And the blog itself, if you'd like to browse around:</p>
<p><a href="https://calliope.bearblog.dev/blog/">https://calliope.bearblog.dev/blog/</a></p>
<p>So, what's going on you might ask? Ok, from beginning to end, here is what my workflow looked like for blogging since Cohost shut down:</p>
<ul>
<li>open a markdown file with the blog's template matter in it</li>
<li>write the post</li>
<li>add in all the metadata stuff in the template area</li>
<li>save and quit</li>
<li>open terminal</li>
<li>navigate to the site's folder on my desktop or laptop</li>
<li>run a node.js command</li>
<li>wait for it to reformat the files it needs to format and push the new ones into html from markdown</li>
<li>close terminal</li>
<li>open github desktop</li>
<li>commit the changes to /public</li>
<li>push the changes to github</li>
<li>close github desktop</li>
<li>navigate to my hosting provider in Firefox</li>
<li>click into the actual hosting side</li>
<li>click into the git version control</li>
<li>click into the pull menu (I have tried for months and cannot skip this set of steps with a push, as every tutorial says I should be able to)</li>
<li>click the button that finds there's an update</li>
<li>click the button that puts the update on the hosting service</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that's <em>enough</em>. But, and I cannot stress this enough, I have <strong>never</strong> published a post and not found an error, typo, or other problem in it afterwards. So I have to go through this entire process at least <em>twice</em> for ever post.</p>
<p>I am tired. I am past the part where I can let myself feel proud that I understand some computing stuff I've always wanted to be able to do. I just want something that works and doesn't make editing a total nightmare.</p>
<p>All my posts are still drafted in markdown files, so they're on my pc in case I have to migrate again for whatever reason. But for now, point your browser, and your eyes, at <a href="https://calliope.bearblog.dev/blog/">my third party blog</a> and your rss reader  <a href="https://calliope.bearblog.dev/feed/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hope, this summer, to turn this site into a proper landing page, with links to all my stuff. Did you know I have <a href="https://gconleymagicart.itch.io/">a itch page</a>? Probably not, since nothing on this site links to it! I need a place to allow people to commission tarot readings. And if I'm fighting just to write, I won't do any of that. I haven't done any of that, <em>because</em> I've been fighting just to write.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
